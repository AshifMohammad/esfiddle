Vision
===

Our vision for [ESFiddle](https://esfiddle.net) is to provide a test bench for the newest ECMAScript features.
We want to encourage usage of these features by a rich library of example code.
Our focus centers around the education and experimentation of new ECMAScript features that people can share with their friends.

#### ESFiddle Roadmap
In no particular order, these are the features/fixes we are working on for the next release
* New homepage with social features
